		-->The internet of things, or IoT, is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, 
		    animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without

-->We learned about MQTT Broker
	->First after installing mqtt in linux,
		we checked  that mqtt is proprely installed or not. for that we run one command
		netstat -ltn (If  there is a port no 1883 is running it is successfdully installed.)
	-> We can simply publish and subscribe the messages to the particular topic like this.
		- mosquitto_pub -t "iot/topic1" -m "hello Iot"
